Ph.D. research: Predicting plant-fungal links with DNA and data mining
------
I am a PhD candidate in the Botany Dept at University of British Columbia Biodiversity Research Centre, co-supervised by T. Jonathan Davies and Quentin C.B. Cronk. I am currently interested in developing and applying computational tools to study the diversity of fungal endophytes and pathogens, their plant host breadth, and their role in non-native plant colonization.

M.Sc. research: Population genetics and phylogeography of rare sedges
------
At the University of Colorado Denver, I conducted population genomic research on <i> Carex scirpoidea </i> subsp. <i> convoluta </i> and subsp. <i> scirpoidea </i> with my supervisor Leo P. Bruederle and Christopher S. Miller.
