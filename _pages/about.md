Ph.D. research: Predicting plant-fungal links with DNA and data mining
------
I am a PhD candidate in the Botany Dept at University of British Columbia Biodiversity Research Centre, co-supervised by T. Jonathan Davies and Quentin C.B. Cronk. I am interested in developing and applying computational tools to study the diversity of fungal endophytes and pathogens, their plant host breadth, and their role in non-native plant colonization.

M.Sc. research: Population genetics and phylogeography of rare sedges
------
At the University of Colorado Denver, I conducted population genomic research on <i> Carex scirpoidea </i> subsp. <i> convoluta </i> and subsp. <i> scirpoidea </i> with my supervisor Leo P. Bruederle and Christopher S. Miller.
  You can find our 2020 paper in <i> Conservation Genetics </i> here: <a>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-020-01326-x</a>

Other activities
------
I work with the UBC BotZoo Wellness Initiative to promote mental and physical well-being among graduate students.
